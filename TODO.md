**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create service-specific mock templates with realistic data
- [ ] Add support for dynamic mock generation based on parameters
- [ ] Include common AWS response patterns and metadata
- [ ] Support for complex data types and relationships

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Auto-generated mocks include realistic sample data
- [ ] Support for complex AWS response structures
- [ ] Templates adapt to detected usage patterns

### 2.3 GUI Configuration Editor
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Impact**: Medium
